# YOLOv12-Based Lane and Object Detection System

This project combines **YOLOv12 object detection** with **lane detection**, real-time video processing, and distance estimation to simulate a smart driving assistant system. It processes road scenes from video input, detects key road objects, highlights lanes, and provides distance estimates for enhanced situational awareness.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv12:
  - Detects classes such as `car`, `bike`, `person`, `traffic light`, `traffic sign`.
- Distance estimation of detected objects using bounding box width.
- Lane detection using:
  - Canny edge detection.
  - Hough Transform.
  - Region of Interest (ROI) masking.
- Real-time video input processing with OpenCV.
- CUDA acceleration for fast inference.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   - Use the following commands:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/aakumar77/yolov12-object-lane-detection.git
     cd yolov12-object-lane-detection
     ```

2. **Prepare your assets**
   - Add your YOLOv12 weights:
     - Place the weights at `weights/yolo12s.pt`
   - Add the video input:
     - Place your video at `video/Test_vid - Made with Clipchamp.mp4`

3. **Run the detection script**
   - Execute the script using:
     ```bash
     python Object\ Detection.py
     ```

4. **Quit the preview**
   - Press `q` while the video window is active to close it.

## üß† How It Works

- **YOLOv12 Object Detection**
  - Loads YOLOv12 model using Ultralytics API.
  - Detects multiple classes frame-by-frame.
  - Filters detections based on confidence score.
- **Lane Detection Pipeline**
  - Converts frame to grayscale.
  - Applies Gaussian blur and Canny edge detection.
  - Uses ROI masking to focus on lane region.
  - Applies Hough Transform to detect lines.
  - Classifies lines as left or right lanes.
- **Distance Estimation**
  - Calculates approximate distance using bounding box width and focal length formula.
- **Frame Rendering**
  - Draws bounding boxes and distance labels.
  - Overlays detected lane lines.
  - Displays the processed frame in real-time.

## üìä Model Evaluation (`YOLOv12_VS.ipynb`)

- Evaluates YOLOv12 model on custom dataset.
- Provides:
  - Detection confidence visualizations.
  - Precision and recall checks.
  - Comparison between different YOLOv12 variants (`yolov12s`, `yolov12m`, etc.).
- Uses Ultralytics `model.val()` and visualization tools.

## üì∏ Sample Output

- Example outputs will be added soon.
  - Sample frame with bounding boxes and distance labels.
  - Lane overlays on detected road segments.

---

## üìå Notes

- You can improve accuracy by:
  - Adjusting lane ROI based on video resolution.
  - Calibrating distance estimation constants.
- Additional module ideas:
  - Traffic sign detection using EasyOCR.
  - Vehicle tracking using SORT.
  - Pothole detection with CNNs or segmentation models.
